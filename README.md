# Unscatter

Hello guys! This is a mobile application made using flutter named ‘Unscatter’. The application will help the users to ‘unscatter’ their everyday classes and extra classes into one place. This will be a big help amidst the hectic day-to-day activities of a student. Students will be able to upload their time table and extra classes if they have any. Later, they can view them and/or edit/delete them as well. We have plans to incorporate assignments as well, but that will depend on its feasibility while coding the application. 

The application allows the user to record their upcoming classes of their university. The classes are displayed on the dashboard sorted according to the latest class. The user will be able to edit the classes. More precisely, the user will be able to add classes, add one-time extra classes, delete all the classes after the semester is over, delete a single class and edit class details.
